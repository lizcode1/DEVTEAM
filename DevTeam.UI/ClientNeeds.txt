You will need to create at least four different classes:
- Two POCOS: 
-Developer
    Developers have Name Typeof(string)
     ID numbers Typeof(int)
    We also need to know whether or not they have access to the 
    online learning tool: Pluralsight. (t/f) Typeof(bool)

- DevTeam
    (You will need to give the POCOs properties)
    Team ID i.e Typeof(int)
    Team members (Developers) List<T>(generic so you can put any properties in the angular T bracket. For this project we will put a list of developers i.e the POCO above) ->Developer> 
    Team Name Typeof(string)

- Two Repositories: DeveloperRepo, DevTeamRepo // collections -> and we can add performance actions on those collections
    and Repos need CRUD methods as appropriate.
-  User Interface  (Console Application)

Clients will typically not give you all the info you need, so you may need to use your brain and peers to fill in the blanks!
 (so feel free to use your own methods and user intereactions inthis application)


Our managers need to be able to add and remove members to/from a team by their unique identifier.
 They should be able to see a list of existing developers to choose from and add to existing teams. Odds are, the manager will create a team, 
 and then add Developers individually from the Developer Directory to that team.

Challenge: Our HR Department uses the software monthly to get a list of all our Developers that need a Pluralsight license.
 Create this functionality in the Console Application

Challenge: Some of our managers are nitpicky and would like the functionality to add multiple Developers to a team at once, 
rather than one by one. Integrate this into your application.
